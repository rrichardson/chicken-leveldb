; A category under which the egg should be listed on the eggs index page (required).
;
; Pick one from the list of categories for your egg and enter it here.
;
; Syntax:
;          (category SYMBOL)
;
; Example:
;
;          (category web)
(category Databases)

; Any extensions needed to build and use this extension. (optional)
;
; A list of eggs your egg depends on.  If none, you can omit this declaration
; altogether. 'depends' is an alias to 'needs'.
; Notice that you should NOT put Chicken units (e.g., srfi-1, srfi-13
; and many others) in 'needs' or in 'depends'.
;
; Syntax:
;          (needs EXTENSION-ID ...)
;
; This should normally be the raw extension-identifier, the same that
; you would use in a require-extension form. Alternatively, EXTENSION-ID
; may be an arbitrary Scheme expression that is evaluated and should
; return a list of extension-ids. This is intended to test the executing
; system for particular platform- or installation-specific features before
; computing a set of required extensions to be available before the
; installation of the original extension commences.
;
; Example:
;
;          (needs sandbox syntax-case)

; Hint a dependency for a non scheme library to the user. The LIB ... is a free
; form clause that is displayed with chicken-install's -show-foreign-depends
; switch. It is expected to be one entry per external dependency.
(foreign-depends libleveldb)

; A list of eggs required for TESTING ONLY. (optional)
;
; See the 'Tests' section.
;
; Just like 'needs' and 'depends', 'test-depends' should NOT contain
; Chicken units.
;
; Syntax:
;          (test-depends EXT ...)
;
;
; Example:
;
;          (test-depends test)
(test-depends test)

; The author, optionally with an e-mail address, if desired (required).

; A short description of the extension (required).
